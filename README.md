# CareerFoundry Project: IMDb Analysis Project
IMDb is an online database for movies, tv shows and more. The dataset I got is 5000 movies worldwide.


 
 ## Objective
I will be using Excel, Python and Tableau to analysis the data to see if the IMDb score, movie year, cast total facebook likes, gross income are related. In this project, I will use linear regression and clustering to look for correlation of the data.

 ## Data
