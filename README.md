# CareerFoundry Project: IMDb Analysis Project
IMDb is an online database for movies, tv shows and more. The dataset I got is 5000 movies worldwide.


 
 ## Objective
 Using skills from this course to analysis the data to see if the IMDb score is correlated with other variables. I will be using Excel, Python and Tableau to work on the analysis.
